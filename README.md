# Nuclear Clone
The bare beginnings of a clone of the game Nuclear Throne, made in the Godot game engine.

See progress directory for roadmap and brief description of what's been implemented.  

Further work is not planned.

If you just want to take a look at some code, look for \*.gd files in src/

Setup:  
* Download Godot from https://godotengine.org/download (or Steam!)  
* Run Godot  
* Press 'Import' and open engine.cfg from this repo  
* Double click the Nuclear Clone entry that appears  

Using the GUI takes a little exploration and a little going through the Godot tutorials.  
To run the game though, just press the play button in the top center, or press f5
